## Before the start

I was so surprised and nervous at the same time, as I thought my skills aren't as expected for this project. But hoped  I will somehow manage to learn and do at the same time

## During

Yeahh, its correct, I don't deserve this(I don't honestly know much stuff for this project, I really wonder how they selected(they shouldn't haveðŸ˜•).I mean compared to my teammates who are doing awesome stuff(they are passionate about and they have idea about obv, i am just doing bare minimum.

## At the end

Whatever, its gng to over(done some things have to oversell them now ðŸ˜• as they are insufficient)

## Aftermath

Okayy its done and my internships fucked up tooðŸ™‚ (as I didn't practice CP).Even the 1lakh I got isn't going me any happiness.
Time to reset myself and work my ass off again.
